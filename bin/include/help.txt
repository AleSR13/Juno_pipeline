Juno pipeline, version $VERSION, built with Snakemake
  Usage: bash $0 -i <INPUT_DIR> <parameters>
  N.B. it is designed for Illumina paired-end data only


Input:
  -i, --input [DIR]                 This is the folder containing your input fastq files.
                                    Default is raw_data/
  -o, --output [DIR]                This is the folder containing your output fastq files.
                                    Default is out/ 

  --genus                           Provide name of an approved genus to be used for CheckM. Please check --help-genera for a 
                                    list of approved genera). Only one name is allowed, so if multiple samples are included in 
                                    the input dir, it will be assumed that they all have the same genus. If different samples 
                                    have different genus, then do not provide a --genus and use --metadata instead

  --metadata                      Excel file (.xlsx) containing the information of the samples and their corresponding genus. It should 
                                    contain at least a column called "Monsternummer" containing the sample ID (same name than fastq files but
                                    removing the suffix _R1|2.fastq.gz) and another one called "genus" containing the name of the genus.
                                    Mind the capital in the name "Monsternummer". Default is: 
                                    /data/BioGrid/NGSlab/BAC_in_house_NGS/In-house_NGS_selectie_2021.xlsx

Output (automatically generated):
  out/                              Contains dir contains the results of every step of the pipeline.

  out/log/                          Contains the log files for every step of the pipeline

  out/log/drmaa			    Contains the .out and .err files of every job sent to the grid/cluster.

  out/log/results		    Contains the log files and parameters that the pipeline used for the current run


Parameters:
  -h, --help                        Print the help document.

  --help-genera			    Prints list of accepted genera for this pipeline (based on CheckM list).

  -sh, --snakemake-help             Print the snakemake help document.

  --clean (-y)                      Removes output (-y forces "Yes" on all prompts).
  
  --no-checkm			    Not run CheckM or update the genus database from CheckM

  --no-genus-update		    Not update the genus database from CheckM

  -n, --dry-run                     Useful snakemake command that displays the steps to be performed without actually 
				    executing them. Useful to spot any potential issues while running the pipeline.

  -u, --unlock                      Unlocks the working directory. A directory is locked when a run ends abruptly and 
				    it prevents you from doing subsequent analyses on that directory until it gets unlocked.

  Other snakemake parameters	    Any other parameters will be passed to snakemake. Read snakemake help (-sh) to see
				    the options.
